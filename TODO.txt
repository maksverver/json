 - json_parse_string() should be merged with decode_string
 - json_parse_number() should not depend on atof() which is locale-dependent
 - support custom allocators? (also useful for testing for memory leaks)
 - more extensive testing would be nice
 - should test existing unit tests against an existing JSON parser
